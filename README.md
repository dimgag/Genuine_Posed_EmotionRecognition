## ðŸ’¾ Dataset:
The SASE-FE Dataset (Kulkarni et al., 2018) created by the iCV Research Lab contains 643 different videos captured with high-resolution cameras recording 100 frames per second, containing video recordings of 54 participants of ages 19-36. The main reason behind the choice of such an age-range sample is that older adults have different, more positive responses than younger adults about feelings and emotions, and they are faster and more precise to regulate emotional states than younger adults (Dahling & Perez, 2010; Isaacowitz, 2012; Ready et al., 2017). More specifically, for each recording, participants were asked to act two facial expressions of emotions in a sequence, a genuine and a posed emotion. Genuine emotions are the six expressions happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, and surprise. For eliciting genuine and realistic emotions, proposed videos based on emotion science research (Gross & Levenson, 1995), were shown to the participants to increase the realism of their emotions. To increase the distinction between the two facial expressions presented in the sequence, the two emotions were chosen based on their visual and conceptual differences. Thus, the contrast was created by asking the participants to act happy after being Sad, Surprised after being Sad, Disgusted after being Happy, Sad after being Happy, Angry after being Happy, and Contemptuous after being Happy. Note that the participants were asked to start their video recordings from a neutral face and none of the participants were aware of the fact that they would be asked to act with a second facial expression.
