1. See what happened from training in VGGFace with DSRI cluster

2. Train VGGFace2 in DSRI for some epochs. 

3. Implement TripleLoss and train the basic CNN with it and also VGGFace and VGGFace2

4. Implement MFL (Multi Focal Loss) and repeat the above experiments

5. Adapt TSM (Temporalm Shiftet Module) to work with your code.
