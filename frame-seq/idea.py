'''Facial landmark localisation refers to the process of detecting and locating specific points on a face, such as the corners of the eyes, the tip of the nose, and the edges of the mouth. This information can be useful in training a network for emotion recognition because the positions of these landmarks can provide important cues about a person's facial expressions.
Here are the general steps you can follow to use facial landmarks localisation to train a network for emotion recognition:
Collect a dataset of images of faces labelled with their corresponding emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.).
Use a facial landmarks detection algorithm (such as the popular DLIB library or OpenCV) to identify and locate key points on each face in the dataset.
Extract the positions of the facial landmarks for each image and use them as input features to train a neural network for emotion recognition. The output of the network should be a probability distribution over the different possible emotions.
Split your dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Use the training set to train the network, the validation set to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set to evaluate the performance of the trained model.
Train your network using a suitable loss function such as categorical cross-entropy or binary cross-entropy depending on the type of output you want.
Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the testing set and fine-tune the model if necessary.
Finally, use the trained model to predict the emotions of new, unseen faces.
It's worth noting that there are many ways to approach emotion recognition using facial landmarks, and the specific details of the approach will depend on the particular dataset and task at hand.'''

'''
This code assumes that you have already collected and labeled an emotion dataset, which has been saved in a numpy archive file emotions_dataset.npz with features in X and labels in y.
The code first initializes the facial landmark detector using the DLIB library and loads the pre-trained shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file.
Next, the code extracts the facial landmarks for each image in the dataset by looping over the images, converting them to grayscale, and detecting faces using the detector object. For each detected face, the code predicts facial landmarks using the predictor object and appends the positions of the 68 landmark points to a list landmarks.
The dataset is then split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection module. The facial landmarks are converted to a numpy array, and the neural network architecture is defined using the Keras Sequential API.
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. The model is then trained for 10 epochs on the training set with a batch size of 32, and the validation set is used for monitoring the performance of the model during training.
Note that the output of the model is a probability distribution over the five possible emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral) encoded as a one-hot vector.
