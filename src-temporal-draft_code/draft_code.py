# From Facebook AI to classify real and fake emotions from videos:
# 1. Collect and label your data: You need a dataset of videos that have been labeled with real or fake emotions.
# 2. Pre-process your data: Convert the videos into sequences of frames or extract relevant features, and divide the data into training, validation, and test sets.
# 3. Choose a TimeSformer: Choose a TimeSformer architecture that suits your needs.
# 4. Train the model: Train the TimeSformer on the training data. Use the validation data to evaluate the model's performance and tune the hyperparameters.
# 5. Evaluate the model: Use the test data to evaluate the final performance of the model. You can use metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall to measure the model's performance.
# 6. Fine-tune the model: If necessary, fine-tune the model by adjusting the hyperparameters or using transfer learning from a pre-trained model.
# 7. Deploy the model: Deploy the trained model to your target platform, such as a web app or mobile app, to make it available for use.

# Note: This is a general outline of the process, and the specific steps and details may vary depending on the specific requirements and architecture of your model.

# In this example, the **`EmotionClassifier`** class defines a simple deep learning model that consists of a series of convolutional layers, a single LSTM layer, and a fully connected layer. The input data is passed through the layers in the **`forward`** method, which returns the model's predictions.

# Note that this is just one example of how you could structure your deep learning model, and you may need to make adjustments depending on the specific requirements of your project.
